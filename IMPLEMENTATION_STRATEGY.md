### GraphQL Resolver Structure
```
src/resolvers/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js              # Main resolver combination
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userResolvers.js      # Authentication & user management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ productResolvers.js   # Product CRUD operations

```

### Caching Strategy
```
Redis Key Patterns:
- products:all:{filter_hash}     # Product listings
- product:{id}                   # Individual products
- user:{id}                      # User profiles
- orders:user:{userId}           # User order history
- analytics:daily:{date}         # Daily analytics
```

### Security Implementation
```
Authentication:
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Rate limiting (100 requests/15 minutes)
- CORS protection
- Input sanitization
